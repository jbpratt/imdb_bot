# Boot the bot

Boot is a websocket client with the following goals:

- [] Search by title using [imdb-index](https://docs.rs/imdb-index/0.1.3/imdb_index/)
- [] Send cat pictures
  - Take user upload, send to queue for validation then on to s3 for storage for posting

To download the files used for searching iMDB, run `./hack/dl-files.sh`

This is learning attempt and my first project in Rust.
